## Task estimation

### Smash your tasks into epics
Tasks are often substantial blocs of many smaller tasks that development team members discover as they carry out the aforesaid task. You should never estimate a task like this. Why not dividing it up instead ? First, you should separate the biggest tasks in themes. Then you might define those biggest tasks as epics and split them into smaller task called user stories. In this way, task estimation - or more accurately user stories estimation - is easier to perform and any mistake due to task estimation is easier to manage. By the way, the list of user stories constitute your product backlog.

### Uncertainty and confidence margins
As a team, you should not blame each other for bad time estimation because a user story estimation will never be perfect; that’s how it is. To keep the team chin up, you might use uncertainty and confidence margins within estimations. For each task evaluation, vote an uncertainty percentage and a confidence one and apply these percentages in the description. Be careful to ensure that the percentage does not exceed 50%. Otherwise, you probably made a bad estimation of the user-story.
